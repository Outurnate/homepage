Title: Tesla Coil: 3D Printed Parts
Date: 2022-07-16

First, a part must be designed to join the secondary coil onto the topload.  After several revisions, I came up with the following design.  The piece acts as a "plug" for the coil form with a single attachment point for a nylon nut

Second, a part must be designed to form the primary coil.  I needed to be able to adjust the height of the primary in the event I needed to adjust the magnetic coupling.  Two parts form a "collar" around the base.  Several pegs are inserted into the collar to create the coil form.  The pegs can be easily reprinted with new holes to adjust the height

<model-viewer alt="pegs render" src="{attach}models/tesla-coil-3d-printed-parts-pegs.glb" poster="" camera-controls></model-viewer>

At this point, the project can be assembled
