First, a part must be designed to join the secondary coil onto the topload.  After several revisions, I came up with the following design.  The piece acts as a "plug" for the coil form with a single attachment point for a nylon nut

Second, a part must be designed to form the primary coil.  I needed to be able to adjust the height of the primary in the event I needed to adjust the magnetic coupling.  Two parts form a "collar" around the base.  Several pegs are inserted into the collar to create the coil form.  The pegs can be easily reprinted with new holes to adjust the height

{{ model(poster="", alt="pegs render", src="pegs.glb") }}

At this point, the project can be assembled
