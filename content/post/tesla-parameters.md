First off, secondary coil parameters.  I'll be using 3.5" (88.9 mm) diameter PVC gas pipe.  Using 509.6 mm of piping and 24 AWG wire, we can fit about 998 turns on the secondary.  For the primary coil, I'll be 6 turns of 16 AWG copper wire.  The coil will be cylindrical with 120 mm diameter and 80 mm tall.  For the topload, I'll be using a torus with an outside diameter of 300 mm and thickness of 75 mm

Based on these parameters, secondary resonant frequency is 345.75 kHz, primary resonant frequency is 81.52 kHz, coupling is 30.4%, and LC impedance is 8.05 ohm

Next step will be to complete the bill of materials for the project
